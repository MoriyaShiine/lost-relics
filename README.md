# Lost Relics

Lost Relics seeks to add unique and powerful loot to ancient structures found in Minecraft. However, rather than just increasing stats or applying a potion effect, these treasures offer a wide range of interesting and unique powers and equipment, but of course, many of them have side effects that might be considered unpleasantâ€¦ I mean, there had to be a reason they were stashed here in the first place?

As of now, seek out the Cursed Amulet, Triple Toothed Snake, Turquoise Eye, and Smoking Mirror in the temples deep in the jungles of the world. They hold great power, but one should be careful of their side effects.

Relics:
```
Cursed Amulet: Causes you to become undead (and optionally become a skeleton), other undead will no longer actively target you, grants immunity to negative status effects, and has a chance to resurrect you on death, but animals will panic near from you, villagers will dislike you, iron golems will instantly attack you, and you take increased fire damage. Increases or decreases armor and attack damage depending on if you're exposed to sunlight.
Smoking Mirror: When worn, deflects damage taken in the form of a smoke ball. When used, summons 4 temporary copies of the user, or a Mirror Demon when sneaking.
Triple Toothed Snake: When used while sneaking, siphons all non-beneficial status effects from the user and imbues it into the blade. The siphoned effects can then be applied to another entity by attacking it, or extracted into Tainted Blood Crystals by crafting. The crystals can be used as ammunition for bows and crossbows, or brewed into a potion.
Turquoise Eye: Highlights entities at full health, which when attacked will take increased damage and be weakened.
```

In the future there will be more added to these structures, other structures, and will also add its own unique set of dungeons and beasts that dwell within.

Coming Soon:
* Additional function to the Turquoise Eye
* Rebalanced spawning
* In-game book
* Jungle Temple Altar: will sometimes generate in Jungle Temples, and will hold 1 relic. In addition, you may offer it 2 relics to get a new one from the jungle relic pool
* Additional Relics, both for jungles and elsewhere
