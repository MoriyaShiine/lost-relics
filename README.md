  <h3>Find unique and powerful artifacts in the ancient structures of the world!</h3>
</div>

Lost Relics seeks to add unique and powerful loot to ancient structures found in Minecraft. However, rather than just increasing stats or applying a potion effect, these treasures offer a wide range of interesting and unique powers and equipment, but of course, have side effects that might be considered unpleasant... I mean, there had to be a reason they were hidden here in the first place?

Seek out the Cursed Amulet, Smoking Mirror, Triple Toothed Snake, and Turquoise Eye in the temples deep in the jungles of the world. They hold great power, but one should be careful of their side effects.

## Jungle Relics
- Found in Jungle Pyramids, resting upon a Jungle Altar.
- Attempting to place a jungle relic on an altar that already contains a jungle relic will reroll into one that is neither of the existing jungle relics.

### Cursed Amulet
- Causes you to become undead and visibly become a skeleton (toggleable).
- Increases or decreases armor and attack damage depending on if you're exposed to sunlight.
- Other undead will no longer actively target you.
- Grants immunity to negative status effects.
- Has a chance to resurrect you on death.
- Nearby animals will panic.
- Villagers will dislike you.
- Iron golems will instantly attack you.
- You take increased fire damage.

### Smoking Mirror
- When worn, reflects half of the damage you take in the form of a smoke ball.
- When used, summons 4 temporary copies of the user, or a Mirror Demon (which instead copies the equipment of its target) when sneaking.
- Phantoms will always spawn at night.

### Triple Toothed Snake
- When used while sneaking, siphons all non-beneficial status effects from the user and imbues it into the blade.
- Imbued effects can be applied to attacked mobs, or extracted into Tainted Blood Crystals by crafting.
- Tainted Blood Crystals can be used either as a projectile or brewed into potions.
- You cannot heal while the blade is cooling down after siphoning.

### Turquoise Eye
- Highlights mobs at full health.
- Attacking a highlighted mob always results in a critical hit, and will weaken and slow them.
- Points towards nearby chests and valuable ores (toggleable).
- You cannot become invisible.
- You will always be highlighted to others.
- Monsters can detect you from farther away.
