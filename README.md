# Lost Relics

Lost Relics seeks to add unique and powerful loot to ancient structures found in Minecraft. However, rather than just increasing stats or applying a potion effect, these treasures offer a wide range of interesting and unique powers and equipment, but of course, many of them have side effects that might be considered unpleasantâ€¦ I mean, there had to be a reason they were stashed here in the first place?

As of now, seek out the Cursed Amulet, Triple Toothed Snake, Turquoise Eye, and Smoking Mirror in the temples deep in the jungles of the world. They hold great power, but one should be careful of their side effects.

In the future there will be more added to these structures, other structures, and will also add its own unique set of dungeons and beasts that dwell within.

Coming Soon:
* Additional function to the Turquoise Eye
* Rebalanced spawning
* In-game book
* Jungle Temple Altar: will sometimes generate in Jungle Temples, and will hold 1 relic. In addition, you may offer it 2 relics to get a new one from the jungle relic pool
* Additional Relics, both for jungles and elsewhere
* ???
